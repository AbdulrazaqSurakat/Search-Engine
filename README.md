# Search-Engine
This C++ project focuses on developing a search engine that allows users to search a large database of information quickly and efficiently. Through this project, students can learn in-depth how memory, structs, and classes work. The Search Engine project involves creating a user interface that allows users to search the database using keywords, categories, and dates. The search engine will support local and remote data sources, including structured and unstructured data. It will also allow users to search and browse indexed data.

Technologies Required: C++ programming language, Data Structures, and Algorithms, Database Management, Memory Management.
